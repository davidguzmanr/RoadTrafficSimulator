- Almost all of the changes can be made in the `main.js` file, the rest of the functions are integrated to the `main.js` file one it is built.
- However, building the file with the original gulpfile erases the changes made in the `main.js` file.
- If you want to change some file outside the main.js it is better to do the changes in the source code and see what changed in the main.js after building it, then copy-paste it (not the best but it works).
- There are a lot of comments that I have made with the changes I have made, they start with "Comment-David"
- Check the `invalid roads` error.
